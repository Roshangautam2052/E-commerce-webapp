I have created the following instructions and details about the project in this file. They are as follows:

Technologies Used
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. PHP programming
4. MYSQL Relational Database

2. Running the website 

1. Open the location where XAMPP has been installed, Open XAMPP folder and paste the project folder in htdocs

2. Start Apache and MySQL

3. Import food-order.sql database provided in the project by going through :localhost:81/phpmyadmin

4. To access the backend for administrator  type localhost:81/food-order/admin
 I have used localhost:81/food-order/admin as my apache was not running on the localhost default port 
please remove this :81 port in constants.php file in admin to run the website to run in your system 

  The username is: admin
  The password is : admin
  
  Then login where you can find the contorls for the administrator 
5. localhost/food-order to access the fronted of the website 

I have incorporated the following features:

1. Categories and Food Items can be browsed by the users.
2. They can order from the website easily.
3. Admin can manage administrator , food items and categories 
4. There is also a functionality to track and manage food order by the admin

Thanks a lot for your time.
